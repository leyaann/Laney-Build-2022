This data set contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user is able to add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings. I chose this data because I was interested to see why certain animes were given a low and higher rating and fanbase.

Does genre have any effect on users preference on rating anime?

Is there any correlation between a certain genre having a higher fanbase?

What is the most liked genre?

Is there any correlation between shows that have more than 20 episodes compared to 10?

What anime has the largest fanbase?

Does the year the anime was produced have any effect on users preference on rating the anime?

What type of anime is preferred? for example (TV, OVA, Movie,etc)

Are there bigger fanbases for animes that are ongoing or were finished in the recent years compared to ones completed in the past years? 

Does the episode and air length of the show have an effect on the rating of the anime?
